# Agri-Advisory App

A Flutter application to provide AI-based, real-time, location-specific crop advisory for small and marginal farmers in India.

## Problem Domain

A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation.

## Goal

This app aims to empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language, helping them make informed decisions to increase productivity, reduce costs, and promote sustainable farming practices.

## Features

- Multilingual, AI-based crop advisory.
- Soil health and fertilizer recommendations.
- Weather-based alerts.
- Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
- Market price tracking.
- Voice support for low-literate users.
